# Get Started

This section is related to the Multisig Realm on Solana network, and it'll cover:

1. What a Multisig Realm is
2. Creating a Realm
3. Adding members to a Realm after the realm is created
4. Upgrading realm's program
5. Adding Treasury account to deposit and send tokens

:::tip
After this read, you'll be able to create and manage your own realm.

Before continue, bear in mind that you'll need to use a Solana wallet (we recommend [Phantom](https://phantom.app/)) and own [SOL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/). For the convenience, it is possible to use the `devnet` to test if your realm is performing as it's supposed to.
